* The game keeps the highscores solo and multi in txt files inside jar folder*

** The whole game was made DYNAMICLY, the concept is that you can REPLACE our questions, images, answers (inside the jar folder) as you like so you can make
YOUR OWN GAME, keeping our Menu/Gui/GameModes. You just have to replace the data in the folders images, questions, answers accordingly 
with some Caughtion in the order because they are paired and sorted, inside the folders. **

*** We used an external library, which we included in the jar folder from the intelij Ide : forms_rt , helped us set up a smoother Graphic 
interface ***
